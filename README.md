I'm a graduate student at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences with a strong interest in AI infrastructure and the open-source community.

My current focus is on building a solid foundation in both the Principles of Deep Learning and the underlying Modern Deep Learning Frameworks. I'm dedicated to understanding how to optimize and scale these systems.

Feel free to connect with me to discuss Python, C++, data structures, and algorithms. I'm particularly interested in how these concepts apply to system-level challenges in AI.
